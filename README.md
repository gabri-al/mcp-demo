# Creating MCP on Databricks
This repo includes the files needed to run a demo of MCP on Databricks.

## Folder structure
* The `mcp-server` folder contains the code relevant to deploy the server as a Databricks Apps. This was created starting from [this repo](https://github.com/databrickslabs/mcp/tree/master/examples/custom-server). The App should be deployed as custom app and then providing the folder path.

* The `tools-local-tests` folder contains the mcp tools that have been tested locally as python functions.
